But tactically,
the Airbenders are not the threat.

74

This isn't about the Airbenders.

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,625
This is about one who lives among them.

The only one
who could possibly stand in our way.

- It wasn't the right time.
- [man 2] The right time?

We don't have the luxury

We need to go talk to the council now.

[man] <i>Aang has always been a prodigy.</i>

147
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,125
The youngest Airbender in history

148
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,583
to receive the markings of a master.

149
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,875
But he is only 12.

150
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,042
We can't ask this of him.

151
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,542
Fire Lord Sozin
is planning to attack the Earth Kingdom.

152
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,667
The Water Tribes are already sending
the warriors to aid the Earthbenders,

153
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,500
and we need to help them as well.

154
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,125
And we need the Avatar.

155
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:35,208
Yes, Aang is powerful,
but there's much he still needs to learn

156
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,500
about responsibility,

157
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,958
expectations,

158
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,792
sacrifice.

159
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,875
Most of all, he needs to know who he is.

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,542
If we send him away
before he learns these things,

161
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:53,417
he could fail to be
everything we need him to be.

162
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,417
And he and the world

163
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,958
might never recover from that.

164
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:04,208
The role of the Avatar
is a heavy responsibility,

165
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,458
not meant for a child.

166
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:10,000
But it is not our place
to choose who bears that burden,

167
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:14,167
and I fear you've grown too close to Aang
to see that, Brother Gyatso.

168
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:15,917
Aang must leave immediately

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,333
to begin training
in the other bending disciplines,

170
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:19,792
and we can only hope

171
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,500
that it is not too late for him
to make a difference.

Are comet festivals always this much work?

00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,013
Well, the last one was
a hundred years ago,

176
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,042
and believe it or not,

177
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,792
I'm actually not old enough
to have seen that.

[chuckles]

180
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,125
Remember the last time I brought you here?

181
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,417
Sure. When I got my tattoos.

182
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,542
Most receive their markings
in the main hall,

183
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,958
but I wanted you to receive yours
in the presence of Yangchen,

184
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,792
the last Air Nomad to be the Avatar.

185
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,500
When she died, the next Avatar was born

186
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,083
into the following nation
in the eternal cycle,

187
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,750
so after Yangchen's death

188
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:13,125
came Kuruk of the Water Tribes,
then Kyoshi of the Earth Kingdom…

189
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,833
And then Roku in the Fire Nation.

190
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:17,833
Which means the next Avatar

191
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,250
will once again be an Airbender.

192
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:25,708
Her spirit echoes in one of us.

193
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:30,250
Aang, you have always been special.

194
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:33,583
The most talented Airbender
I have ever known.

195
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,958
I never asked to be special.

196
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,042
But you are.

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Aang,

198
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:43,458
you are the Avatar.

to throw the world out of balance.

202
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:58,333
Only the Avatar, the one person
who can master all four elements,

203
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,708
can save the world.

204
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,333
The world needs the Avatar.

205
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,708
The world needs you, Aang.

206
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,875
You're to leave right away so you can
begin training in the other disciplines.

Right away?

Leave my friends? Leave home? Leave you?

209

Now, this

210
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,417
would be a huge burden for anyone,

211
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,125
but you're not just anyone, Aang.

212
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,042
You're strong

213
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,083
and kind

214
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,083
and generous.

215
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,542
Remember that.

216
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,000
Always remember who you are

217
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:38,042
because I can't imagine a better person
to have been given this power.

I don't want… the power.

Which is why you will make a great Avatar.

220

Why do I have to be different?

221

Can't I just

keep pretending that I'm your friend?

We've been manning the wall
in three-hour shifts,

347

but it seems some of you can't be trusted
to stay at your posts.

The fishing boats came back empty.

They don't appreciate
your incredible leadership skills.

That's right. They don't realize it.

[gentle flute music playing]

So where were you before?

00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,000
You were waterbending again, weren't you?

365
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,292
Don't worry. No one could see me.

366
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,375
Not that it matters.

367
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,213
Of course it matters. If the Fire Nation
finds out you're a Waterbender...

368
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:29,417
No one from the Fire Nation
has approached the village in years.

Besides, there's nothing to see.

An otter penguin
could bend more water than I could.

371
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,667
It's probably for the best.

372
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,000
You should be helping out more
around the village anyway.

- Waterbending is what built our culture.

Keeping it alive is our duty.

What is it, Gran Gran?

This is an Airbender.

It's impossible.
Airbenders don't exist anymore.

Well, we won't get any answers
until he wakes up.

We need to let him rest.

That's where we have to go.

- Where you think we'll find the Avatar?
- Yes.

440
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:06,792
Because of the light?

441
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,125
You think I'm imagining things?

442

Sometimes, light beams are nothing more
than celestial glimmers in the winter sky.

For three years,
I've chased down every hint, every rumor,

every whisper of the Avatar,

445
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:26,125
and I'll keep doing it
for another three years if I have to.

Prince Zuko,
I don't think your father would want you...

00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,958
My father has banished me
until I find the Avatar,

448
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:35,125
and that's exactly what I'll do.

449
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:39,667
All I'm saying is,
it's hard to see you get your hopes up

450
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,208
every time you see a…

a sign.

452
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,667
It'll all be worth it
once I return home in glory

453
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,542
to take my place
as the rightful heir to the Fire Lord.

[sighs]

455
00:29:56,708 --> 00:30:00,375
Perhaps it's time to consider
that the throne isn't everything.

456
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,500
It may not have been for you.

00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,000
My sky bison.

499
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:16,875
Six legs, horns, brown arrows?

500
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,667
Sky bison.

501
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:22,042
- Sky bison!
- Repeating it doesn't help.

[Appa grumbles]

512
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,917
You say you went down in the storm?

513
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,167
It came upon us suddenly.

514
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,542
The weather went crazy
just after I left home.

515
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,042
The Southern Air Temple.

516
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,333
Where the Air Nomads live.

517
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,083
Well, not all the Air Nomads,

518
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:03,042
but most of them had just arrived
for the Great Comet Festival.

519
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,750
The Great Comet Festival.

520
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:08,875
Gran Gran?

521
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,083
[mysterious music playing]

522
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:15,292
Water, earth, fire, air.

523
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:19,333
Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.

524
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:23,500
Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.

525
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:27,917
Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,

526
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,208
could stop them.

527
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,958
But when the world needed him most,

528
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:34,667
he vanished.

529
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:39,000
And so the Fire Nation
marched and laid waste,

530
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,125
plunging us into a time of darkness.

531
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,875
Everyone in the village knows this story,

532
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,583
but you don't, do you, young man?

533
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:56,125
Just as you don't know that Airbenders
haven't been seen in generations

534
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:59,708
and that the Southern Air Temple
was the first to fall,

535
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:03,875
because you've been trapped
in that ice this whole time.

536
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,708
The last time that the Great Comet
was seen in the sky

537
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:11,000
was 100 years ago.

538
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:19,708
He may seem like just a boy,

539
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:21,458
but he's much more.

540
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:26,083
He is the last Airbender.

541

[wind gusting]

543
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:38,250
Of all the places to drag our asses to,
he picks the coldest spot in the world.

544
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,458
How come his omens never take us
somewhere with hot springs, huh?

- No, sir.

547
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,792
[Zuko] Let me make something clear.

548
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,750
Our mission is vital
to the future of the Fire Nation,

549
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,042
and so we will find the Avatar.

550
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,000
We will prove ourselves worthy,

551
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,708
and we will see
our homes and families again…

552
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:09,500
or we will die trying.

A hundred years.

All my friends,

559
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,208
everyone I know…

560
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,083
they're all gone.

561
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,625
Um, I'm sorry.

Believe me, I know how hard it is
to lose the people you love.

[wind whistling]

564
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:55,833
When I was little,
I didn't really understand the war

565
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,750
until the night the Firebenders came.

566
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:02,500
They destroyed everything in their path.

567
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:04,792
Everything.

568
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,167
Everyone.

569
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,537
Afterwards, our father set out
with the other warriors

570
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,917
to hunt down the Firebenders.

571
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,000
That was three years ago,
and we haven't seen him since.

572
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,750
He had left Sokka in charge
when he just turned 13.

573
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:25,000
I guess he had to grow up fast.

574
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:27,833
We all did.

575
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,000
We're never really ready

576
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:35,542
until we have to be.

577
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:48,542
They were part of the Fire Nation's
first attacks on the Water Tribe.

578
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,792
The Firebenders were ruthless.

579
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,167
Since then, the Fire Nation
has conquered most of the world.

580
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,583
But the Waterbenders
are still fighting back,

581
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,417
especially in the North.

582
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,417
And the Earth Kingdom
is still holding strong.

We hope.

I had friends in the Fire Nation.

00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:12,875
I used to visit them.

586
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,125
No one visits other nations now.

587

of Earth Kingdom soldiers single-handedly.

594

Well, you've certainly prepared enough.

Now, how about a nice cup of jasmine tea?

596
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:54,667
Say we find the Avatar,
and you're able to defeat him,

597
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,417
a mission
your father believed to be impossible.

598
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,125
And so your return home may be…

599
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:03,875

Barely. I'm trying to get better,

but I'm the only Waterbender left
in the Southern Tribe.

608
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,792
Sokka doesn't like it when I practice

609
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:46,000
because he's worried
that the Fire Nation will find out and…

610
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,208
And what?

611
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:53,333
There's a reason I'm the only Waterbender
left in the village.

612
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,042
They've killed all the others.

Sokka just doesn't understand.

I'm a warrior. I should be able
to do more for our people.

The monks told me
bending is about energy and balance.

616
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:13,250
By feeling the energy around you,
you can find balance.

After all this time,
what could they possibly want?

Him.

When the world needed the Avatar the most,
he vanished because he's a coward.

We have no desire to take your homes.

Someone who is not one of you.

Turn him over now,

or I'll burn this place to the ground.

- Where is he?
- Sokka, you can't give him to them...

- He doesn't belong here.
- It's wrong. You know that!

What I know
is Dad told me to protect the village.

Yes, but remember what Mom told us too.

She said that we have to protect those
who can't protect themselves.

He's lost everything he knows.

- And he lied to us about it!

I know how hard
this responsibility has been for you,

something to live for.

660
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,833
That's what the Avatar is. He's hope.

661
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:24,875
And we need that
just as much as we need food and shelter.

662
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:26,875

On behalf
of the Water Tribe Village of Wolf Cove,

672
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:10,125
I demand that you leave immediately!

673
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,792
If this is the path you've chosen,

674
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,583
then so be it.

675
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:19,333
Let's settle this between us!
Leader to leader. You really need an army?

676
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,333
I thought you Firebenders had some guts.

677
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:25,708
Don't fall for it.
We overpower them. It's no contest.

678
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:27,072
Well, where's the glory in that?

679
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:31,417
I accept.

I'll go with you. Just leave them alone.

I'm the one you're looking for.

- Get him.
- Wait!

698
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,208
[Aang] It's okay, Katara.

699
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,625
No one has ever fought for me before.

700

I think you're the bravest person
I've ever met.

701

We have to do something.
Sokka, we have to help him. Sokka!

702
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,667
Okay, listen up.

703
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,625
Reinforce the braces on the gate,
and don't fall behind on drills.

704
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,250
- I saw real sloppiness out there today.
- Drills?

705
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:05,375
And don't let the younger ones
push you around.

706
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:08,375
You gotta let 'em know who's in charge.
That's right.

707
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:10,833
You're in charge.

708
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:14,917
Now, let's go save that weird kid.

There are many who never imagined
this day would ever come, myself included.

713
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,125
Can I ask you something?

714
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:37,375
- Uh…
- Forgive me.

715
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,958
I'm Iroh, son of Fire Lord Azulon.

716
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:43,167
And of course.

717
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:47,167
Why did the Fire Nation start this war?

718
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,250
Ah.

719
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:51,750
Some people say it is within our nature

720
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:55,167
to expand and consume like fire itself.

721
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:59,208
Others believe
that true stability in this world

722
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:01,250
can only happen under our rule,

723
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:05,875
so the drive to conquer
is a drive for peace and unity.

724
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:10,208
But peace comes from respecting life,
not killing and destroying.

725
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:12,083
[Iroh] A noble sentiment, Avatar,

726
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,833
but in the end, for most of us,

727
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:17,500
it doesn't matter how this war started.

728
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:19,583
It only matters how it can end.

729
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:22,792
And the belief is that by capturing you,

730
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,375
the Fire Nation
can finally bring that about.

731
00:47:27,542 --> 00:47:29,042
Is that what you believe?

732
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:37,292
I must leave, but I look forward to
many more conversations with you, Avatar.

733
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:41,958
In the meantime,
I'll have some jasmine tea sent to you.

734
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,958
It's quite soothing. [chuckles]

Hopefully, we can find a swift current.
Maybe draft off their wake.

<i>You are my friend.</i>

827
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:13,625
You will always be my friend.

[Aang weeping]

833
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,375
[Sokka] So not to be rude,
but what was that?

834
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,250
I don't know.

835
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,292
There's so much I don't know.

836
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:27,958
The monks are gone, and I'm all alone.

837
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:30,333
You know,

838
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:33,042
the thing about losing everything

839
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,833
is that that's when you learn
how strong you really are.

840
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:38,042
It's when you learn to fight.

841
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:44,000
[Aang] They made
the ultimate sacrifice for me.

842
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,208
I need to make sure
their deaths weren't in vain.

843
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:49,417
I need to follow through
on what they wanted me to do.

844
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,417
Complete my training
and master all the other bending skills

845
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,542
so I can bring balance back to the world.

846
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:55,708
Oh, is that all?

847
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,042
This was my home, and now it's gone.

850
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,333

851
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:14,833

[Aang] <i>Anything.</i>

854
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:25,708
I don't know where this will all lead,
and I don't know if I have what it takes,

855
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,458
but the one thing I do know is

856
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:31,417
I'm the Avatar,

857
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:34,250
